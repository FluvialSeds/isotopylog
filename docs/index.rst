Welcome to the isotopylog documentation
=======================================

``isotopylog`` is a Python package for analyzing "clumped" isotope kinetic data; it is particularly suited for assessing carbonate clumped isotope (i.e., ∆\ :sub:`47`\) bond reordering and closure temperatures, but will be expanded in the future to include clumped isotopes of other molecular species (e.g., sulfate). This package currently performs two basic functions: 

(1) it fits ∆\ :sub:`47`\ reordering data from carbonate heating experiments (inverse model) and 
(2) it predicts geologic ∆\ :sub:`47`\ evolution given any time/temperature sample history (forward model). 

For both functions, the package can use any of the available clumped isotope kinetic models: (1) the "pseudo-first-order" model (Passey and Henkes, 2012), (2) the "transient defect/equilibrium defect" model (Henkes et al., 2014), (3) the "pair-diffusion" model (Stolper and Eiler, 2015), and (4) the "disordered kinetic" model (Hemingway and Henkes, 2020).

This package allows users to quickly and easily assess whether their clumped isotope measurements reflect primary signatures, or if these values have been reset during diagenetic heating. Similarly, it also allows users to easily assess geologic cooling rates using the apparent "closure" or "blocking" temperatures recorded in carbonates that have been diagenetically heated.

Package features
----------------
``isotopylog`` currently contains the following features relevant for clumped isotope data analysis:

* Stores, culls, and plots experimental kinetic isotope data

  * Easily converts between multiple reference frames (e.g., Ghosh, CDES90)
  * Plots forward-modeled predictions using rate parameters (i.e., k values) in order to visually assess goodness of fit

* Estimates the rate parameters (i.e., k values) of bond reordering kinetics for a given set of experimental results using any of the following models:

  * Pseudo-first-order model (Passey and Henkes, 2012)

  * Transient defect/equilibrium defect model (Henkes et al., 2014)

  * Paired-diffusion model (Stolper and Eiler, 2015)

  * Disordered kinetic model (Hemingway and Henkes, 2020)

    * Calculates best-fit regularized ("smoothed") rate distributions using Tikhonov Regularization

      * Automated or user-defined regularization value

    * Determines best-fit lognormal rate distributions

* Determines activation energy values using an Arrhenius fit to rate parameters
  
  * Generates Arrhenius plots
  * Allows quick and easy importing of literature data

* Calculates and stores model performance metrics and goodness of fit statistics

* Ability to update published model kinetics, either by manually entering kinetic results or by fitting new experimental data

* Predicts clumped isotope evolution for a given geologic time/temperature history:

  * Allows users to assess if their results reflect primary signatures or diagenetic overprinting.

* Includes propagated uncertainty estimates for all heating experiment model fits, Arrhenius activation energy fits, and geologic history forward-model predictions.
  
  * Includes analytical uncertainty weighting factors when calculating heating experiment rate values.

  * Accounts for model parameter covariance using a numerical Jacobian approach.

Future Additions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Future versions of ``isotopylog`` will aim to include:

* Additional models as they become available

* Kinetics of non-carbonate molecular species (e.g., sulfate) as they become available
